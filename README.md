# Cinematicket from https://cinematicket.org/

This project is my first project with Reactjs and I used these technologies: 

1-redux for logging in 

2-react-router-dom for routing and changing api of each page

3-axios for getting data from the orginal site : https://cinematicket.org/

4- reactstrap, antd for designing and making it responsive 

5-Swiper for sliders

In this project you can see details of each movies and theaters and you can search 20 movies because I could not find the api which has everything inside. You can either sign up or log in in your account
